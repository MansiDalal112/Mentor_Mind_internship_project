# 🚨 Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here 🚨

## I Have No Idea What’s Happening

Welcome to my GitHub repo, where the only thing more lost than my code is me.  
If you’re looking for inspiration, solid programming, or even basic logic-keep scrolling. Seriously, save yourself.

### What’s This Repo About?  
I wish I knew.  
I think it’s about computer networks, but honestly, at this point, it might be about existential dread.  
I don’t know how to code. I don’t know why I’m coding.  
I’m not even sure how I got here.  
If you find any working code, please let me know so I can celebrate (or check if I accidentally copied it from somewhere).

### What You’ll Find Here:  
- Random files named `final_final_REAL_final_version2.py`  
- Code that only works when nobody is looking  
- Comments like `# I have no idea what this does`  
- Bugs that refuse to be fixed, even by exorcism  
- Desperate cries for help hidden in the comments  
- The occasional meme to distract from the chaos

### Why Am I Doing This?  
Great question. My therapist is still trying to figure that out.

### Should You Use This Code?  
Only if you enjoy living dangerously.

This repo may cause headaches, confusion, and a sudden urge to take up knitting instead.  
Proceed at your own risk.  
If you actually understand what’s going on here, please send me a message-I need friends.
